## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is a system that helps manage changes to documents, programs and other collections of information.It tracks modifications,enabling multiple users to collaborate on thesame project without each others work.The fundamental concept of version control is that it has a repository which is a central place where all the flies for a project are stored.It helps in maintaining project integrity by keeping a complete history of all changes.
